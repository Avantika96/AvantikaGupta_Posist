The following code is creating the structure required for the nodes of the record along with:
1. Creating the genesis node.
2. It creates two children of each node.
3. It checks if the sum of values of all nodes is less than genesis node. If it is greater it restricts to make that node.
4. It assigns 32bits node Id to each node.
5. It encrypts the data to its ascii character, if the owner will type the correct passkey i.e "abcd" then only he will be able to view the original data.
